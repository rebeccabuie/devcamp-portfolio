      <p>Soon after high school, I started out with a job I was supposed to do basic work for, such as taking photos and cutting them out in photoshop. I was also shipping and packaging orders. I have been with the company for 5 years and during that time I was introduced to graphic and basic web design.<

      <p>I fell in love with design and am always looking to get better. I have 4 solid years building, editing, and managing two websites for the business I work for. I was able to learn HTML and CSS and how to incorporate it with platforms like Magento and Wordpress. I’m looking to expand my knowledge in web building and design. I learn fast and I’m always up for a challenge!</p>
